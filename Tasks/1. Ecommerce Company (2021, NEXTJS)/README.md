# Purpose of project

This project was done as a take-home task for an interview I was a part of. It was bootstrapped with CRA and uses TypeScript. The only external module used is react-modal.

## View the project in the web

You can see the project without installing anything at [https://kind-heisenberg-e003eb.netlify.app/](Netlify). Mobile responsiveness wasn't a requirement so I haven't really worked on it. Please use a desktop to access the website.

## First time running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn && yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Running the project subsequently

### `yarn && yarn start`

## Assignment for the take-home task:

Create a simple web app with only 2 pages.

The first page:

Title - the text “Products” that
is also a link to the second page

Random text and a picture underneath
the title

Footer with links to the Home
and Products pages

The second page:

Sticky header with welcoming text
on the left side and a small avatar on the right side

The same footer from the first
page

A list of products in the middle
with the following columns: id, name, description, image

Three actions for the table elements - Add, Update, Delete

Add - should create new rows in
the table. Could be done with a separate popup with a form or any way you think is fit (the UI is up to you). Required fields are: id, name and description. Id should be unique and name should be at least 3 characters long. Image is optional.

Update - same requirements as
for the add action but for an existing record. The required and optional fields are the same. Again the UI is up to you.

Delete - action should simply
remove a record from the table.

You are free to use any colors, paddings, margins, borders, fonts, etc. you like. The most important thing is code structure and code styling.

Task requirements:

ReactJS as a dependency

The list of products should be custom made

The products should be in a json file and all actions should have a 0.5 secs delay.

There is no limit to the number of libraries you can use.

Instructions on how to run the project should be included in the readme.

When finished, commit the code to a public repository and email us the link.
